## Author's Description
A start to finish tutorial series covering all aspects of development, design, art, animation and programming. 

Using C++ & SDL we will create our own custom game engine create the characters, tile sets in Pyxel Edit & Photoshop and then adding some custom music and sounds.

With Quick Tips being published bi-weekly and a deep dive at least once a week follow along whilst I show you how to make your own game. 

If there are any requests throughout any part of this, please leave a comment or message me and I will strive to help either via message or perhaps create a video replying to the message.

Thanks for visiting ;)
